\begin{abstract}
Hyper-Connections (HC) generalizes residual connections by introducing dynamic residual matrices that mix information across multiple residual streams, accelerating convergence in deep neural networks. However, unconstrained residual matrices can compromise training stability. To address this, DeepSeek's Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (\mHC) approximately projects these matrices onto the Birkhoff polytope via iterative Sinkhorn--Knopp (SK) normalization. We identify two limitations of this approach: (i) finite SK iterations do not guarantee exact doubly stochasticity, leaving an approximation gap that can accumulate through network depth and undermine stability; (ii) efficient SK implementation requires highly specialized CUDA kernels, raising engineering barriers and reducing portability. Motivated by the Birkhoff--von Neumann theorem, we propose \textbf{\mHC-lite}, a simple reparameterization that explicitly constructs doubly stochastic matrices as convex combinations of permutation matrices. This approach guarantees exact doubly stochasticity by construction and can be implemented using only native matrix operations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \mHC-lite matches or exceeds \mHC in performance while achieving higher training throughput with a naive implementation and eliminating the residual instabilities observed in both HC and \mHC. The code is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/FFTYYY/mhc-lite}.

% \section*{Accessibility}

% Authors are kindly asked to make their submissions as accessible as possible
% for everyone including people with disabilities and sensory or neurological
% differences. Tips of how to achieve this and what to pay attention to will be
% provided on the conference website \url{http://icml.cc/}.

% \section*{Software and Data}

% If a paper is accepted, we strongly encourage the publication of software and
% data with the camera-ready version of the paper whenever appropriate. This can
% be done by including a URL in the camera-ready copy. However, \textbf{do not}
% include URLs that reveal your institution or identity in your submission for
% review. Instead, provide an anonymous URL or upload the material as
% ``Supplementary Material'' into the OpenReview reviewing system. Note that
% reviewers are not required to look at this material when writing their review.

% Acknowledgements should only appear in the accepted version.
% \section*{Acknowledgements}

% \textbf{Do not} include acknowledgements in the initial version of the paper
% submitted for blind review.

% If a paper is accepted, the final camera-ready version can (and usually should)
% include acknowledgements.  Such acknowledgements should be placed at the end of
% the section, in an unnumbered section that does not count towards the paper
% page limit. Typically, this will include thanks to reviewers who gave useful
% comments, to colleagues who contributed to the ideas, and to funding agencies
% and corporate sponsors that provided financial support.

% \section*{Impact Statement}

% Authors are \textbf{required} to include a statement of the potential broader
% impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future societal
% consequences. This statement should be in an unnumbered section at the end of
% the paper (co-located with Acknowledgements -- the two may appear in either
% order, but both must be before References), and does not count toward the paper
% page limit. In many cases, where the ethical impacts and expected societal
% implications are those that are well established when advancing the field of
% Machine Learning, substantial discussion is not required, and a simple
% statement such as the following will suffice:

% ``This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of Machine
% Learning. There are many potential societal consequences of our work, none
% which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.''

% The above statement can be used verbatim in such cases, but we encourage
% authors to think about whether there is content which does warrant further
% discussion, as this statement will be apparent if the paper is later flagged
% for ethics review.

% In the unusual situation where you want a paper to appear in the
% references without citing it in the main text, use \nocite
\nocite{langley00}
